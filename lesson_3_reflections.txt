When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
When using multiple computers and/or multiple people editing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
By auto updating it may overwrite something that you were working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are a copy of someone elses repository which you do not have
permission to edit, via github. Clones are a copy of a repository and
can reside locally and remotely, they do not link back to the original
like forks do. Branches are essentially different versions within the
same repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Provides you with the most current code to work from if you are away from a source of internet
