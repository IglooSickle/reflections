How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Because of the easy visual comparison!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can see exactly when a feature was added and which new blocks of code is related to it

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros would be the commit would ideally be compilable and after a change. Cons would be if you forget to commit, making too many changes to be easily trackable

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is more intended for coding, which may change multiple files per commit. Whereas Google Docs is more for, well, documents which are not so closely linked together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to show all the commits and git diff to show the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's so easy to revert to a last known good version, change away!!!!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For tracking my android development!!
